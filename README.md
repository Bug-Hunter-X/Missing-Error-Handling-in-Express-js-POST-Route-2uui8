# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in API routes.  The example shows a POST route that lacks proper error handling, resulting in unhelpful 500 errors to the client and a lack of detailed information for debugging.

## Bug
The `missingErrorHandling.js` file contains an Express.js route that creates a new user.  It uses promises, but error handling is minimal, just logging the error to the console and sending a generic 500 status code.  This provides no useful feedback to the client about what went wrong.

## Solution
The `missingErrorHandlingSolution.js` file shows how to improve the error handling by:

1.  **Explicitly checking `req.body`**: Before processing the request body, check if the necessary data exists and is in the correct format.  This prevents unexpected errors from poorly formatted requests.
2.  **Detailed Error Handling**:  Instead of a generic 500 error, use appropriate status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).  Return descriptive error messages to the client, enabling them to address issues.
3.  **Logging**: Use structured logging to capture all necessary information about errors, which helps with debugging.

This enhanced error handling provides better feedback to clients and simplifies debugging for developers.
